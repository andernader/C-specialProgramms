A set of special programms from Neso Academy : C Programming And Data Structure.
Within these programms I playe with different Algorithems and we countered interfereing with text, numbers, arrays and maniplulating them and thier digits.
We faced math.h functions like pow(); ceil(); and sqrt(); I played with string functions from string.h and ctype.h like strlen(); strcpy(); strcmp(); and strcasecmp(); also 
functions like toupper(); and tolower(); and many more.
